# 🚗 CO₂ Emissions Prediction

This project predicts the **CO₂ emissions (g/km)** of vehicles based on various engine and fuel consumption features. It uses machine learning models to help understand how different car specifications impact environmental emissions.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

Given features such as:
- Engine Size (L)
- Cylinders
- Transmission
- Fuel Type
- Fuel Consumption (City, Hwy, Combined)
  
...predict the **CO₂ Emissions** a vehicle will produce.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset was sourced from the [Government of Canada Open Data Portal](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data), and contains vehicle specs and CO₂ emissions for multiple car models from various manufacturers.

**Features include:**
- `Make`
- `Vehicle Class`
- `Engine Size (L)`
- `Cylinders`
- `Transmission`
- `Fuel Type`
- `Fuel Consumption (City, Hwy, Comb)`
- `CO₂ Emissions (g/km)`

---

## 🧠 Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost (optional)
---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed:
- Distribution analysis of CO₂ emissions
- Correlation matrix of numerical features
- Outlier detection
- Feature importance ranking

---

## 🧪 Training and Testing

- Data was split into train and test (e.g., 80/20).
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV (for RandomForest/XGBoost).
- Model evaluation and comparison.

---

## ✅ Key Insights

- Higher engine size and fuel consumption values are positively correlated with CO₂ emissions.
- Transmission and fuel type also affect emissions, though less directly.
- Random Forest performed better than Linear Regression based on R² score.
